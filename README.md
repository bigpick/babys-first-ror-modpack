# Baby's First Modpack (a Risk of Rain 2 modpack)

> A modpack of the best character, item, skin, and QOL mods - so you don't have to do it yourself

This was made for friends and family. I am not supporting it outside of that. Good luck!

## Using

After having r2modman installed, **create a new mod profile** by selecting the **Create new** button
on the initial r2modman menu.

Name it "Babys First Modpack profile" and then make sure it is the selected profile, then click the
**Select Profile** button.

The profile should have 0 installed mods.

Navigate to the **Online** tab and search **"Baby's First Modpack"**. Click **Download**.

Then enjoy playing!

## Publishing

Note: the Thunderstore is dumb, and you need to `zip -rj`, not including the parent path as part of
the zip, since it looks for `manifest.json` straight up, and a parent path in the zip will
break it.
